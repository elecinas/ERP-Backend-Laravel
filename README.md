# ERP-Backend-Laravel

For this project, whe have a given repo named ERP-Backend-Laravel, with a GitHub remote URL named  https://github.com/it-academyproject/ERP-Backend-Laravel.git 

Remember to use git checkout branchName to switch branches if needed.

Given a GitHub remote repo with files .gitignore and README.md already in it, and wanting to set up a LARAVEL project inside that repo, we have done the
following steps in console:

1. Clone the repo from remote to local:	git clone https://github.com/it-academyproject/ERP-Backend-Laravel.git

2. Access that folder in local: cd ERP-Backend-Laravel
* (optional) check the branch we're in is "dev": git branch

3. If the default is main branch, Switch to Dev branch: git checkout Dev (console give us feedback of branch switched)

4. Create a new project using command "composer create-project laravel/laravel iteracion_laravel"
